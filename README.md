# The-fake-american-idol
To "sell" the story of The American Dream of course is necessary to have American idols and pump op their value so the rednecks believe in it and buy it! So this book is about is how the "America Market for America Idols work"! I have a 20 years experience of America from the bottom to the TOP of the lifestyle, the idols and demons and from being a character in the show to running the show! I have this image in my eyes with the first pump station where the unleaded gallon was $0.70 and now is $3.70! So where, by whom and how a America end up in the hand of the biggest con man of the most "sold family" in last century!
